# cdn-bot
the absolute weird discord-bot from my discord-server.

When trying to use it, create a `config/config.properties` in the same folder of the jar, and put in your application's bot-token, like `application_token=yourBotToken`

If the files doesnt exist, or you dont have a correct token, it won't work.

Requires intent `MESSAGE_CONTENT` to be enabled in the developer-portal. like this:

To be safe for the future, just enable all intents, like in the image.
